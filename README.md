# Students_grade_checker-using-hash-map
students grade checker is a software application design to manage and retrieve students grades quickly and efficiently(by using hash map also known as hash table)
Components:

1.Hash Map Implementation: A custom or built-in hash map data structure is used to store student records, with student IDs as keys and their grades as values.

2.User Interface: A front-end interface (could be a web application, desktop application, or command-line tool) that allows users to interact with the system.

3. Backend Logic: The server-side logic that handles data operations like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student grades.

4. Database: An optional component where the hash map data can be persisted, allowing the system to retain information between sessions.

Functional Requirements

1. Add Student Grades: Users can add new student records with their respective grades.

2. Update Student Grades: Users can update the grades of existing student records.

3. Delete Student Grades: Users can remove student records from the system.

4. Retrieve Student Grades: Users can query the system to retrieve the grade of a specific student using their student ID.



Technical Details

Programming Language: The project can be implemented in any language that supports hash map data structures, such as Java, Python, C++, or JavaScript.

Frameworks: Depending on the chosen language, frameworks like Flask (Python), Spring (Java), or Node.js (JavaScript) can be used for developing the backend and API endpoints.

Database: For persistent storage, relational databases like MySQL or NoSQL databases like MongoDB can be used.


Example Use Case

1. Adding Grades: A teacher enters the student ID and the grade into the system. The hash map stores this information with the student ID as the key.


2. Retrieving Grades: A user queries the system by entering a student ID. The hash map quickly returns the corresponding grade.


3. Updating Grades: A teacher updates a student's grade by entering the student ID and the new grade. The hash map updates the record accordingly.


4. Deleting Grades: A user removes a student's record from the system by entering the student ID. The hash map deletes the entry.



Benefits

Speed: Fast data retrieval and update operations due to the hash map's efficient handling of key-value pairs.

Simplicity: Easy to implement and use, with straightforward interfaces and functionalities.

Scalability: Can handle a large number of student records without significant performance issues.
